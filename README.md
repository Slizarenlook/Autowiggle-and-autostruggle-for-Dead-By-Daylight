# Autowiggle-and-autostruggle-for-Dead-By-Daylight
In order to make this script work you need to set your wiggle buttons as 'A' and 'D' and struggle button (which is also a button for skillchecks) as space. Script is easy to use, simply  push 'F' abd you will start struggling or push 'G' and you will start wiggling, to stop wiggling or struggling just push 'V'.
